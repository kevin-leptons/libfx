libfx_inf - fx infrastructure library

C is freedom programming language. C language allows programmers do every
things which hardwares can. It is powerfull, also weakness because programmers
can go to correct ways or wrong ways. And C language lacks few of essential
concepts such as coding standard or error handling, C language lets
programmers to decide that.  If you are a C programmer then you know what is
that when you deal with error handling model, allocate and release resources.
There are many ways to do with pros/cons but you do not know what should you
choice. t is wasted time, stress and painful.

This package provides solution to deal with freedom in C language. Package
contains both specifications and APIs to do that and used as infrastructure
for any fx's package. You can read detail concepts in next sections.

Let contribute this package. This package may be one in many ways to deal
with freedom in C language. It may be good way, may be bad way but it is one
way. If you think you can do it better, just let we know because we know that
some things are not good is exists in this package and we are not satisfied
with it but we can not find better way.

Here are concepts:

        :maxdepth: 1
