Part 1. Introduction
====================

**libfx** is set of packages, an package provides documents and
implementations for concepts which relates with computer programming.
Documents are write by nature language and to be use as a way to get
knowledge about concepts, also as guide to use implementations.
Implementations are write by programming language and to be use as APIs to
write programs, for specific programming language is C.

**libfx** describes concepts and give implementations under the **libfx** name
to help programmers do thier job and do together. For example, **libfx**
provides vector, hash table, thread pool or TCP handling model. Unlike in the
case use other packages with different styles, **libfx** is unique clauses, it
saves resources such as time, money and working.  Programmers can be student,
researcher, developer or any one, they can use or contribute to **libfx** if
they have base knowledge about computer programming.

Packages aims to both hosted and freestanding environments.If package runs on
hosted, it must be independent between hosts, called cross platform. So some
packages can runs on embeded system, some packages must be runs on kernel of
operating system. Let consider carefully destination environments while
create new packages or use early existed packages.

Implementations by C language because C language is freedom. That mean C
language provides essential concepts and let programmers decides concepts what
they need. There are few other reasons but freedom is most important. Compare
with other language such as C++: C++ provides three concepts are OOP, RAII,
and exception together, if disable one of them to use alternative concepts
then C++ is not C++. Or with Python, it hides raw memory concepts so
programmers can not do work with memory exactly.

**libfx** exchanges freedom by hard working. Because C language provides
essential concepts, more work to, it is result and can not be avoid
completely. If some one need do work quickly, please consider other solutions.

Here are fork, Go to :ref:`spec` to use or :ref:`dev` to contribute **libfx**.
